// Transformation of the IR, taking what would become trivial unary operations
// and maps them to a single @IdentityMap pseudo instruction.
//
// To motivate further, in order to produce nice IR on the other end, generally
// the operands of these trivial expressions needs to be forwarded and treated
// as the destination value (identity mapped).  However, directly removing these
// instructions will result in broken LLVM IR (consider zext i8, i32 where both
// the source and destination would map to TCGv_i32).
//
// Moreover, handling these identity mapped values in an adhoc way quickly
// becomes cumbersome and spreads throughout the codebase.  Therefore,
// introducing @IdentityMap allows code further down the pipeline to ignore the
// source of the identity map.
